""" ''''''# üå∂Ô∏è Question 5

Now say you can no longer buy fractions of a gallon.  (For instance, if you need 4.3 gallons to do a project, then you have to buy 5 gallons of paint.)

With this new scenario, you will create a new function `get_actual_cost` that uses the same inputs and calculates the cost of your project.

One function that you'll need to use to do this is `math.ceil()`.  We demonstrate usage of this function in the code cell below.  It takes as a number as input and rounds the number up to the nearest integer.  

Run the next code cell to test this function for yourself.  Feel free to change the value of `test_value` and make sure `math.ceil()` returns the number you expect.'''''' """

    new_gallon_value = math.ceil(gallons_needed)
    cost = cost_per_gallon * new_gallon_value
    return cost
